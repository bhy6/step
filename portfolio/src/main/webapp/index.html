    <h2>Postal Operations</h2>
    <p>I ran a company for five years that had $1.2 million 
        worth contracts with the  United States Postal Service. 
        I learned about the bidding process, offer analysis, technical 
        analysis, cost itemization, payroll, federal-state-municipal 
        regulations, operational scaling, finance-budgeting, fleet 
        maintenance, route optimization, and business management... just to name a few.</p>
